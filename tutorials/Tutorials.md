# :dart: Tutorials
Overall, JGNN provides machine learning primitives (e.g. tensors, matrices),
neural components that can be parsed under `ModelBuilders` to create
new models. 
Tutorials cover the following subjects:

# Introduction
1. [Learning](tutorials/Learning.md)
2. [Neural networks](tutorials/NN.md)
3. [Graph neural networks](tutorials/GNN.md)

# Advanced topics
4. [Primitives](tutorials/Primitives.md)
