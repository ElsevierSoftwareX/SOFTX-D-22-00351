# :dart: Tutorials
Overall, JGNN provides machine learning primitives (e.g. tensors, matrices),
neural components, model builders that parse expressions to create components, 
model initializers, and training strategies.
Tutorials cover the following subjects:

## Introduction
1. [Learning](Learning.md)
2. [Neural networks](NN.md)
3. [Graph neural networks](GNN.md)

## Advanced topics
4. [Primitives](Primitives.md)
5. [Debugging](Debugging.md)
