# JGNN
A native Java library for Graph Neural Networks.

# :brain: About
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are getting more and more popular;
they can reason from relational information and perform inference from small datasets.
JGNN provides capabilities to native Java applications and supports cross-platform machine
learning, such as on Android. It avoids
c-based machine learning libraries (e.g. [tensorflow lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) ).
the require specific hardware or firmware to run and increase the size of applications.


# :zap: Quickstart
