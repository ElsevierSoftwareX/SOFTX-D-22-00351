# JGNN
A native Java library for Graph Neural Networks.

# :brain: About
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are getting more and more popular;
they can reason from relational information and perform inference from small datasets.
JGNN provides capabilities to native Java applications and supports cross-platform machine
learning, such as on Android. It avoids
c-based machine learning libraries (e.g. [tensorflow lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) ).
the require specific hardware or firmware to run and increase the size of applications.


# :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
For quick installation of the latest working version of the library, you can include it as Maven or Gradle dependency by following the instructions found in the following JitPack distribution page:
